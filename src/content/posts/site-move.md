### 有关本次迁移的 FAQ

#### 为什么评论系统坏掉了？

2024 年 9 月 20 日，Deta Space 发出公告：

```plaintext
Dear Deta Community,

After an incredible run, we've made the difficult decision to shut down Deta Space. You can continue to login until sunset on October 17, 2024, at which point we will start deleting all Horizons, apps (hosted or installed) and data in Collections.

We've built tools for exporting your data (and code for developers), with tutorials available in the docs.

We wanted to thank you for joining the journey so far. Everything we've done wouldn't have been possible without our community, mods, investors, and friends. We hope you'll stick around for what's next.

What's next for Deta?
The team is working on what we think is our most exciting product yet: Deta Surf. We can't wait to onboard people in the very near future. If you were a fan of Deta's past products, we'd love if you popped by.

Why are we sunsetting Space?
As a team, we want computing on the web to be more personal, powerful and fun. Space (& our earlier products) were built in this vein. But they didn't really hit enough for us to continue. We're a startup and at some point, we have to move on from good (& bad) products in search of really great ones.

We're still searching, and the team is working on Deta Surf. We've been pretty quiet about it, but it takes learnings from everything we've built. We'd love if you checked it out.

What about my account?
You can export all your code and data. You can decide if you want to delete your account entirely or be kept in the loop about Deta Surf .

How long will the service be available?
The service will be available until October 17, 2024. After that, all Horizons, apps (hosted or installed) and data in Collections will be deleted.
```

公告指出，Deta Space 将于 2024 年 10 月 17 日关闭，所有数据将全部删除。而本人的 Waline 系统部署于 Deta Space，因此无法继续使用。

数据已经经过备份，但可能因为 URL 匹配问题不在使用久旧数据。

正在全力寻找最有部署方案，以恢复评论运行！

#### 这次的新方案是什么？

采用 Astro + React 搭建，将 Portfolio 与旧博客的一部分整合，打造一站式个人站点。

#### 以前的旧博客还有用吗？

有的，敬请期待！

好的，以上就是本次迁移的一些事项，祝各位工作/学习顺利、天天开心快乐！！！
